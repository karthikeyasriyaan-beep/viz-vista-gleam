  { question: "What is Trackora and how does it help me manage my finances?", answer: "Trackora is a comprehensive personal finance management platform designed to help individuals and families take complete control of their money. Unlike simple expense trackers that only record transactions, Trackora provides a complete financial ecosystem where you can manage daily expenses across categories like food, transport, and entertainment; track multiple income sources including salary, freelance work, and investments; monitor loan repayments with interest calculations and payoff timelines; control subscription costs with renewal alerts; and work toward meaningful savings goals with visual progress tracking. The platform transforms complex financial data into clear, actionable insights through beautiful charts and visualizations, helping you understand exactly where your money goes and make informed decisions that build long-term wealth." },
  { question: "Is Trackora really free to use?", answer: "Yes, Trackora is completely free to use with all core features included at no cost. This includes unlimited expense and income tracking, loan and debt management, subscription monitoring, savings goal tracking, budget planning with alerts, and comprehensive analytics. We believe financial management tools should be accessible to everyone regardless of their economic situation. There are no hidden fees, no premium tiers locking essential features, and no credit card required to sign up. Our commitment is to democratize personal finance management by providing professional-grade tools at no cost." },
  { question: "How do I create an account on Trackora?", answer: "Creating a Trackora account is simple and takes less than 60 seconds. Click the 'Get Started' or 'Start Free Today' button on our homepage. Enter your email address and create a secure password (we recommend at least 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols). You'll receive a verification email to confirm your account—check your spam folder if you don't see it within a few minutes. Once verified, you can immediately start tracking your finances. No credit card, no phone number, no extensive personal information required. Your account is protected with bank-level 256-bit encryption from the moment you sign up." },
  { question: "Is my financial data safe with Trackora?", answer: "Absolutely. We take your security extremely seriously because we understand that financial data is among the most sensitive information you have. All your data is encrypted using bank-level 256-bit AES encryption both in transit (when data moves between your device and our servers) and at rest (when stored on our servers). We use the same security standards as major financial institutions. Our servers are hosted on secure, SOC 2 compliant infrastructure with regular security audits and backups. We implement HTTPS everywhere, secure authentication protocols, and regular penetration testing. Most importantly, we never sell, share, or monetize your personal financial information—your data belongs to you alone." },
  { question: "Who can see my financial information?", answer: "Only you. Your financial data is completely private and belongs to you alone. Trackora staff cannot access your personal financial information unless you explicitly grant permission for support purposes, and even then, access is limited and logged. We follow a strict data privacy architecture where your sensitive information remains encrypted and protected. We don't sell or share your data with advertisers, data brokers, or any third parties. Our business model doesn't depend on exploiting your personal information—we're focused solely on building the best financial management tool possible." },
  { question: "Which currencies does Trackora support?", answer: "Trackora supports multiple currencies to serve users worldwide. Currently supported currencies include Indian Rupee (₹), US Dollar ($), Euro (€), British Pound (£), Japanese Yen (¥), Australian Dollar (A$), Canadian Dollar (C$), Swiss Franc (CHF), and many others. You can set your preferred currency in the Settings page, and all your financial data—expenses, income, loans, savings goals—will be displayed in that currency. The currency selector is available in the top navigation for quick switching if you need to view amounts in different currencies. We're continuously adding more currencies based on user requests." },
  { question: "How does expense tracking work in Trackora?", answer: "Expense tracking in Trackora is designed to be as quick and effortless as possible while still capturing meaningful data. To add an expense, simply click the 'Add Expense' button, enter the amount, select or type a category (Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, Entertainment, etc.), and optionally add a note for context. The entire process takes under 5 seconds. Trackora provides intelligent category suggestions based on your history—if you frequently log 'Zomato' expenses as Food, it will automatically suggest that category. All expenses are immediately reflected in your monthly totals, category breakdowns, and analytics. You can filter expenses by date range, category, or amount, and edit or delete any transaction at any time." },
  { question: "Can I track multiple income sources?", answer: "Yes, Trackora allows you to track unlimited income sources with full categorization. Whether you have salary from an employer, freelance payments from clients, rental income from property, dividends from investments, gifts, or any other income type, you can log each separately with its source, amount, date, and optional notes. This is particularly valuable for freelancers and gig workers who need to track variable income from multiple clients, or for anyone with diverse income streams. The income tracking feature helps you understand your true monthly average income, identify seasonal patterns, and compare total income versus expenses to see exactly how much you're saving each month." },
  { question: "How does the loan and debt tracker work?", answer: "The loan tracker helps you manage all types of debts in one unified view. For each loan—whether it's a personal loan, student loan, home loan, car loan, credit card balance, or money borrowed from friends—you can enter the loan name, original amount, current balance, interest rate, and monthly EMI. Trackora then calculates your payoff timeline, showing when you'll be debt-free if you continue current payments. You can see how much total interest you've paid and how much remains. Visual progress bars show your journey from the original loan amount to zero, providing motivation to stay on track or accelerate payments. The tracker also helps you compare multiple debts so you can prioritize which to pay off first using strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche method." },
  { question: "How does subscription management help me save money?", answer: "The average person spends ₹2,000-5,000 monthly on subscriptions they barely use or have forgotten about. Trackora's subscription management feature brings all your recurring charges into one view—streaming services (Netflix, Prime, Hotstar), music apps (Spotify, Apple Music), software tools (Office 365, Adobe), cloud storage, gym memberships, magazine subscriptions, and more. For each subscription, you enter the name, amount, billing cycle (monthly, quarterly, yearly), and next renewal date. Before each renewal, Trackora sends you a notification asking if you still need this subscription. This simple prompt has helped users identify and cancel forgotten subscriptions worth thousands of rupees per year. The dashboard also shows your total monthly and yearly subscription costs, often revealing spending levels that surprise users." },
  { question: "How do savings goals work?", answer: "Savings goals in Trackora help you save with purpose and motivation. Create a goal for anything—emergency fund, dream vacation, new laptop, wedding fund, home down payment, child's education, or a new car. For each goal, set a target amount and optional deadline. As you add money toward the goal, visual progress rings show how close you are to achieving it. Trackora celebrates milestones along the way: hitting 25%, 50%, 75% of your goal triggers encouraging messages. Research shows that visualizing progress increases the likelihood of reaching goals by over 40%. You can have multiple active goals, prioritize them, and track contributions over time to see your savings journey unfold." },
  { question: "How does budget planning work in Trackora?", answer: "Budget planning in Trackora follows a simple principle: give every rupee a purpose. You can set monthly spending limits for individual categories (for example, Food: ₹8,000, Transport: ₹3,000, Entertainment: ₹2,000) or set an overall monthly spending limit. As you track expenses throughout the month, color-coded progress bars show how much you've spent versus your limit. Green means you're well under budget, yellow indicates you're approaching your limit, and a gentle notification reminds you to slow down if needed. The system is designed to be encouraging rather than punitive—we use positive language like 'You're doing great this month!' instead of harsh warnings. You can view historical budget performance to see how your spending has evolved over time." },
  { question: "What analytics and insights does Trackora provide?", answer: "Trackora transforms your financial data into beautiful, easy-to-understand visualizations that reveal patterns you might never notice otherwise. The analytics dashboard includes: monthly spending breakdown by category with colorful pie charts; income vs expense comparison over time with trend lines; spending trend analysis across weeks, months, and years; identification of spending patterns and anomalies; category-wise comparison between different time periods; and subscription cost summaries. Beyond basic charts, Trackora provides actionable insights like 'You spent 35% more on dining out this month compared to last month' or 'Your utility bills have increased 20% over the past quarter.' These insights help you spot issues early and make informed adjustments to your spending habits." },
  { question: "Can I export my financial data?", answer: "Yes, you have complete ownership of your data and can export it anytime. From the Settings page, you can export all your financial data in CSV or JSON format. This includes your complete expense history with dates, amounts, categories, and notes; all income records; loan and debt details; subscription information; savings goals and contributions; and budget configurations. Exported data can be used for tax filing purposes, imported into spreadsheet software for custom analysis, shared with a financial advisor, or simply kept as a backup. We believe your financial data belongs to you, and you should always have full access to it in portable formats." },
  { question: "Is there a mobile app for Trackora?", answer: "Trackora is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it works beautifully on mobile browsers and can be added to your home screen for a native app-like experience—without downloading anything from an app store. On your phone, simply open Trackora in your browser (Chrome, Safari, or any modern browser), tap the browser menu, and select 'Add to Home Screen.' This creates an icon on your phone that launches Trackora instantly, just like a native app. The PWA approach ensures you always have the latest version without waiting for app store updates, and it works across all devices—Android, iOS, tablets, and desktop—with a consistent experience. We're exploring dedicated iOS and Android apps for the future, but the PWA provides full functionality today." },
  { question: "What devices can I use Trackora on?", answer: "Trackora is a web-based application that works seamlessly on all devices with a modern browser. You can access it from desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux), laptops, tablets (iPad, Android tablets), and smartphones (iPhone, Android phones). The interface automatically adapts to your screen size—on larger screens you see more data at once, while on mobile the layout adjusts for touch interaction. Because it's web-based, your data syncs automatically across all devices. Start adding an expense on your phone during lunch, and see it reflected on your laptop when you check your analytics in the evening. No downloads, no installations, no manual syncing required." },
  { question: "How do I reset my password if I forget it?", answer: "If you forget your password, click the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page. Enter the email address associated with your account, and we'll send you a password reset link within a few minutes. Check your spam or junk folder if you don't see the email in your inbox. Click the link in the email, and you'll be able to create a new secure password. For security, the reset link expires after 24 hours. If you're still having trouble accessing your account, contact our support team at support@trackorapp.in with your account email, and we'll help you regain access." },
  { question: "Are you GDPR and CCPA compliant?", answer: "Yes, Trackora is fully compliant with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for European users and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) for California residents. This means you have the right to know what personal data we collect and why; access all your data at any time (and export it); request correction of inaccurate data; request deletion of your data ('right to be forgotten'); object to certain types of data processing; and data portability (transferring your data to another service). You can exercise these rights through the Settings page or by contacting our support team. Visit our Privacy Policy page for complete details on how we protect your information and respect your data rights." },
  { question: "Can I delete my account and all my data?", answer: "Yes, you have complete control over your account and data. You can delete your account at any time from the Settings page. When you choose to delete your account, all your personal data—expenses, income records, loans, subscriptions, savings goals, and profile information—will be permanently removed from our servers within 30 days. This deletion is irreversible, so we recommend exporting your data first if you want to keep a copy. Before deletion, you'll receive a confirmation prompt to ensure this is intentional. We respect your right to be forgotten and make the process straightforward." },
  { question: "How do I contact Trackora support?", answer: "Our support team is available to help with any questions, issues, or feedback. You can reach us at support@trackorapp.in or use the contact form on our Contact page. We typically respond within 24-48 hours, though we often reply much faster during business hours.

On your phone, simply open Trackora in your browser (Chrome, Safari, or any modern browser), tap the browser menu, and select 'Add to Home Screen.' This creates an icon on your phone that launches Trackora instantly, just like a native app. The PWA approach ensures you always have the latest version without waiting for app store updates, and it works across all devices—Android, iOS, tablets, and desktop—with a consistent experience."

        {
          q: "Can I use Trackora offline?",
          a: "Basic viewing functionality works offline—you can see your previously loaded data, review your analytics, and navigate through the app. However, adding new transactions, syncing data, and accessing the latest updates requires an internet connection. We're actively working on enhanced offline capabilities that will allow you to add expenses while offline and automatically sync them when you reconnect. For now, we recommend having an internet connection when logging transactions to ensure your data is saved and backed up securely."
        },
        {
          q: "Is Trackora accessible for users with disabilities?",
          a: "We're committed to making Trackora accessible to everyone. The platform follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines with keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and proper semantic HTML structure. We use sufficient color contrast ratios, provide text alternatives for visual elements, and ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible. If you encounter any accessibility issues or have suggestions for improvement, please contact us at support@trackorapp.in. We actively work to improve accessibility based on user feedback and are committed to ensuring Trackora is usable by people of all abilities."
