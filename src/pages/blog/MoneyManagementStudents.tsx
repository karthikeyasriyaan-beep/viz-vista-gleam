                College and university life offers incredible opportunities—but it also brings financial challenges. Learning to manage money as a student sets the foundation for lifelong financial success. The habits you build now will serve you for decades to come.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Student Financial Literacy Matters</h2>
              <p>
                Many students graduate with degrees but lack basic financial skills. This gap leads to unnecessary debt, poor credit decisions, and financial stress that can take years to overcome. By mastering money management now, you'll graduate with something even more valuable than your degree: financial competence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The financial decisions you make as a student—how you handle student loans, credit cards, and daily expenses—will impact your financial health for years after graduation. Smart choices now mean more freedom and opportunities later.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Creating Your Student Budget</h2>
              <p>
                A budget isn't about restriction—it's about awareness and intention. As a student, your budget will likely be tight, making it even more important to know where every dollar goes.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Identifying Your Income Sources</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Save on Textbooks</h3>
              <p>
                Textbooks can cost hundreds per semester, but there are ways to reduce this expense:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Rent instead of buy when possible</li>
                <li>Buy used textbooks from previous students</li>
                <li>Check the library for reserve copies</li>
                <li>Use digital versions when available</li>
                <li>Share textbooks with classmates</li>
                <li>Sell your books after the semester</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Master Food Costs</h3>
              <p>
                Food is often one of the largest controllable expenses for students:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Cook meals instead of eating out</li>

                <li>Use student discounts at local restaurants</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Leverage Student Discounts</h3>
              <p>
                Your student ID is a powerful money-saving tool:
              </p>

              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Student Loans</h2>
              <p>
                If you have student loans, understanding them is crucial for your financial future:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Know Your Loan Types</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Subsidized loans:</strong> Government pays interest while you're in school</li>
                <li><strong>Unsubsidized loans:</strong> Interest accrues from disbursement</li>
                <li><strong>Private loans:</strong> From banks or private lenders, often with higher rates</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Smart Loan Management</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Borrow only what you need—not the maximum offered</li>
                <li>Understand your total debt and future payments</li>
                <li>Consider paying interest while in school to reduce total cost</li>
                <li>Know your grace period after graduation</li>
                <li>Research repayment plan options</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Building Credit Responsibly</h2>
              <p>
                College is a good time to start building credit—but only if done responsibly:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Credit Card Guidelines for Students</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Start with one card:</strong> A student credit card with a low limit</li>
                <li><strong>Pay in full:</strong> Never carry a balance if you can avoid it</li>
                <li><strong>Keep utilization low:</strong> Use less than 30% of your limit</li>
                <li><strong>Pay on time:</strong> Set up automatic payments to never miss due dates</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid cash advances:</strong> The fees and interest are extremely high</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Building Credit Without Cards</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

                <li>Pay all bills on time (some report to credit bureaus)</li>
              </ul>
